# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis & Visualization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores a large **weather dataset** to uncover patterns and relationships between different meteorological factors. Using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**, the dataset undergoes **cleaning, visualization, and analysis** to address key weather-related questions.  

## 🔍 Key Objectives  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Pre-processing** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovering trends in temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Using **scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps** to present insights  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, Correlation Analysis  

## 📊 Key Findings  
### 1️⃣ **Relationship Between Maximum Temperature & Rainfall** 🌧️  
- **Method:** Scatter Plot  
- **Insight:** No strong correlation found, but high temperatures tend to coincide with **low rainfall**.  

### 2️⃣ **Wind Speed Variation Across Different Wind Directions** 💨  
- **Method:** Box Plot  
- **Insight:** Wind speed **varies significantly** by direction, with **NW & SE having higher speeds**.  

### 3️⃣ **Correlation Between Humidity & Temperature** 🌡️  
- **Method:** Heatmap  
- **Insight:** **Negative correlation** (-0.72) between **humidity and temperature**, showing that higher temperatures lead to lower humidity.  

## 🚀 Challenges & Learnings  
- **Missing data required strategic handling** for better accuracy  
- **Visualization selection was key** to uncovering clear insights  
- **Findings can be applied** to **climate modeling, agriculture, and urban planning**
